# React Server-Side Rendering Example

React & Redux on Client and Server sides.


## Development

- Go to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the server:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

Now, the application is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
The homepage is Sever Rendered and (http://localhost:3000/non-ssr) is client side rendered.
